2. The merged format is known as the Merlin wIZzard format (MIZ). The default file extension is .miz.
3. Each section begins with a `//@FileName` comment, indicating the original file path.
4. Only modified sections will be included in the merged file.
5. Unchanged sections will not appear in the merged file.
6. To modify specific sections, locate the corresponding `//@FileName` comment.
7. When extracting files, use the Merlin utility with the 'extract' command to separate the merged content into individual files.
8. For any changes, it's recommended to modify the original source files and re-run the merge process.

## Important Notes
- This file is auto-generated. Manual changes to this merged file may be overwritten in future merges.
- The `//@Header` line at the beginning of the file should be ignored when processing the content.
- Only updated sections (indicated by `//@FileName`) will be present in this merged file.

## Usage
When generating a response in Merlin file format:
1. Include all updated `//@FileName` sections in their entirety.
2. Do not use placeholders or abbreviated content (e.g., "// ... other things unchanged ...", "// the same ...").
3. Provide the complete, updated content for each modified section.
4. Exclude any unchanged `//@FileName` sections entirely.
5. Omit the `//@Header` line from the response.
6. Ensure that all changes and updates are fully represented in the included sections.
